Every May, millions of Europeans gather around their televisions to watch one of the worlds biggest spectacles and to partake in the cultural phenomenon that has shaped European relations since the fifites. The Eurovision song contest is held every year. Each of the 50 countries that participate send an artist or group to perform an original song. The result is a weeklong celebration of unity, peace, and cooperation. But also (maybe more importantly), a celebration of sequins, wind machines, and outrageous musical performances. You can read more about it [here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/everything-americans-need-to-know-about-eurovision) and [here](https://eurovision.tv/).

To determine a winner, the viewers at home vote. The only rule is that you cannot vote for your own country. The votes are counted, and every country gives out 12, 10, 8 - 1 points to the 10 countries that received the most votes. These votes are then tallied and one country comes out victorious and will host the competition the following year. 

The contest is non-political by nature, but every year you hear complaints of neighbor-voting, or the opposite; complaints that a neighboring country *didn't* give you enough points. Speaking from personal experience, I know that Norwegians are beyond annoyed if Sweden and Denmark do not give us enough points. 

This neighbor voting is a problem that keeps surfacing in the competition, but is there actually a correlation between the distance between countries and the amount of votes they give each other? 

In this tutorial we will examine the voting data from 1975 - 2019 to see if distance between countries make a significant difference in voting patterns.

(For the 2019 competition they changed the voting rules by adding a jury who has power over 50% of a country's vote. You can read more about it [here](https://eurovision.tv/story/tonight-juries-decide-50-percent-of-the-eurovision-2019-result).)

##Data:

First we will import the voting data and examine the information it gives us. The dataset used here has been downloaded from kaggle. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datagraver/eurovision-song-contest-scores-19752019/downloads/eurovision-song-contest-scores-19752019.zip/1)
We will also be using a dataset with information about countries found [here](https://worldmap.harvard.edu/data/geonode:country_centroids_az8). 
```{r data_prep, message=FALSE}

eurovision <- read_excel("/Users/Astrid/Downloads/eurovision_song_contest_1975_2019.xlsx")
countries <- read_csv("/Users/Astrid/Downloads/country_centroids_az8.csv")

head(eurovision)
```

Here we see the 6 first rows in our dataset. 

###Some observations we can make:

 * The data shows us the point values given by each country to other contestants.
 * The data shows us if the votes were cast by a jury or by televotes.
 * Several column names have spaces in them, this will cause problems in r. 
 * The data does not tell us anything about the relationship between the countries, so we will have to add that.
 * Some of the countries in 'eurovision' do no longer exist (e.g. Yugoslavia) or have changed names (e.g. Macedonia).
 
##Tidying:

* Fix the column names that have spaces in them:

    - Write a function that replaces spaces with underscores, removes parentheses, and removes hyphens. 

```{r tidying, message=FALSE}
names(eurovision)<-str_replace_all(names(eurovision), c(" " = "_", "\\(" = "", "\\)" = "", "-" = ""))
```
 
* Add information about the relationships between countries:
    - We will use data from our 'countries' table to calculate the distances between the countries.
    - First we have to import the longitude and latitude data from 'countries' to 'eurovision'.
    - Then we make changes to 'countries' and 'eurovision' to prepare them for merging.
    
    
```{r tidying2, message=FALSE}
countries <- countries %>% 
  select(admin, continent, Longitude, Latitude) 
eurovision <- eurovision %>% filter(is.na(Duplicate)) %>% select(-Duplicate)

#Change names in 'eurovision' in order to match 'countries' and vice versa.
eurovision$From_country[eurovision$From_country == "F.Y.R. Macedonia"] <- "Macedonia" 
eurovision$To_country[eurovision$To_country == "F.Y.R. Macedonia"] <- "Macedonia"
eurovision$From_country[eurovision$From_country == "North Macedonia"] <- "Macedonia"
eurovision$To_country[eurovision$To_country == "North Macedonia"] <- "Macedonia"
eurovision$From_country[eurovision$From_country == "The Netherands"] <- "The Netherlands"
countries$admin[countries$admin == "Republic of Serbia"] <- "Serbia"
countries$admin[countries$admin == "Bosnia and Herzegovina"] <- "Bosnia & Herzegovina"
countries$admin[countries$admin == "Netherlands"] <- "The Netherlands"

#There are some countries that have competed in eurovision that do not exist anymore. Here, we add these countries to 'countries' and estimate the central coordinates based on its location in relation to modern countries.
countries <- rbind(countries, c("Yugoslavia", "Europe", 17.76876733, 44.17450125))
countries <- rbind(countries, c("Serbia & Montenegro", "Europe", 20.78958334, 44.2215032))

#Merge 'eurovision' and 'countries' by 'From_country' to add lat and lng 
eurovision <- merge(x = eurovision, y = countries %>% select(Longitude, Latitude, admin), by.x = c("From_country"), by.y = c("admin"))
colnames(eurovision)[colnames(eurovision)=="Longitude"] <- "From_Longitude"
colnames(eurovision)[colnames(eurovision)=="Latitude"] <- "From_Latitude"

#Merge 'eurovision' and 'countries' by 'To_country' to add lat and lng 
eurovision <- merge(x = eurovision, y = countries %>% select(Longitude, Latitude, admin), by.x = c("To_country"), by.y = c("admin"), all.x = TRUE)
colnames(eurovision)[colnames(eurovision)=="Longitude"] <- "To_Longitude"
colnames(eurovision)[colnames(eurovision)=="Latitude"] <- "To_Latitude"

#Make sure lng and lat data is numeric.
eurovision$From_Longitude <- as.numeric(eurovision$From_Longitude)
eurovision$From_Latitude <- as.numeric(eurovision$From_Latitude)
eurovision$To_Longitude <- as.numeric(eurovision$To_Longitude)
eurovision$To_Latitude <- as.numeric(eurovision$To_Latitude)

head(eurovision)
```

  - Now that we have longitude and latitude information for both to and from countries, we can create a column that measures the distance between the center of the countries. Here we will use the funtion 'distHaversine' in order to measure the distance between two coordinates, taking into account the curvature of the earth and other important factors.
  
```{r tidying3, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(geosphere)


setDT(eurovision)
eurovision <- eurovision[, distance_hav := distHaversine(matrix(c(From_Longitude, From_Latitude), ncol = 2),
                                   matrix(c(To_Longitude, To_Latitude), ncol = 2))]

```


##Exploratory Data Analysis:

Now that we have cleaned up the data and added some information to the table, we can start taking an initial look at our data. 

Because we are looking for correlation between voting and distance between countries, we will make some initial discoveries about the data.

First we can look at the countries who have received the most points in the competition:

```{r EDA, message=FALSE}
eurovision %>%
  group_by(To_country) %>%
  summarise(Point_sum = sum(Points)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Point_sum)) %>%
  head()
```
We see three countries close in proximity at the top. This might indicate something about our hypothesis, but lets dive deeper.

We can find an ordering of the total sum of points given from one country to another.

```{r EDA1, message=FALSE}
  eurovision %>% 
  group_by(From_country, To_country) %>% 
  summarize(total_point = sum(Points)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_point))  %>%
  head()

```

This data gives us more confidence as we keep exploring our data. All the top voting exchanges have been between countries in the same regioins of Europe. 

One more check we can do is by building a network graph. This will show us the relationships between the countries' voting records, and by sizing the edges according to the amount of votes given, we will be able to see more about the countries who have a history of voting for each other.

```{r EDA2, message=FALSE}
library(GGally)
library(network)
library(sna)
library(ggplot2)


eurovision_temp <- eurovision %>% group_by(From_country, To_country) %>% summarize(total_point = sum(Points))

eurovision_temp <- eurovision_temp[!(eurovision_temp$To_country==eurovision_temp$From_country | eurovision_temp$total_point == 0),]

#Make sure every edge weight is between in (0,1)
eurovision_temp$edge_weight <- eurovision_temp$total_point / 470

#Round up all edges with a weight lower than 0.01 to 0.01 in order to see them more clearly.
eurovision_temp$edge_weight[eurovision_temp$edge_weight < 0.01] <- 0.01

my_net = network(eurovision_temp %>% select(From_country, To_country), directed = TRUE, matrix.type="edgelist")

ggnet2(my_net, label = TRUE, arrow.size = 6, arrow.gap = 0.025, edge.size = as.vector(eurovision_temp$edge_weight))

```

This graph is a little too messy for our purposes. There are too many arrows pointing to every vertex, making it hard to distinguish details.

Because we mostly care about the higher number of votes in our EDA section, we can extract the relationships between countries that have the most votes between them. Let's try plotting the countries above that lie above 50% of the top sum:

```{r EDA3, message=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
eurovision_temp1 <- eurovision_temp %>% filter(edge_weight >= 0.5)

my_net = network(eurovision_temp1 %>% select(From_country, To_country), directed = TRUE, matrix.type="edgelist")

ggnet2(my_net, label = TRUE, directed = TRUE, arrow.size = 6, arrow.gap = 0.025, edge.size = as.vector(eurovision_temp1$edge_weight), palette = "GnBu")

```

This is again very interesting, and the information is still in line with our hypothesis that proximity plays an important role in voting. The groups of vertices we see here are all somewhat connected to the countries in their respective groups. One group has many of the northern european countries plus the UK, Ireland, The Netherlands, and Belgium. Another group has Greece and Cyprus, another has Albania and Macedonia. As we predicted earlier, these groups of countries are connected both culturally and geographucally and it gives us a good start for our more in-depth statistical experiment.

##Clustering analysis:

So far, we have used a lot of approximation in our exploration of the data. Our hypothesis that there is neighbour voting has not been disproven yet, so now we can dig deeper with some statistical analysis. 

First we have to determine how many clusters are optimal for our data:
Because of the unproportional distances, we will filter out Australia from our tables to minimize the outliers.

```{r ML, message=FALSE}
library(factoextra)

eurovision_temp <- 
  merge(x = eurovision_temp, y = eurovision %>% select(distance_hav, To_country, From_country), by = c("To_country", "From_country"), all.x = TRUE) %>% 
  distinct() 

eurovision_temp <- eurovision_temp %>%
  filter(From_country != "Australia") %>%
  filter(To_country != "Australia")

standardized_euro <- eurovision_temp %>%
  mutate(mean_point = mean(total_point)) %>%
  mutate(sd_point = sd(total_point)) %>%
  mutate(z_point = (total_point - mean_point) / sd_point) %>%
  mutate(mean_dist = mean(distance_hav)) %>%
  mutate(sd_dist = sd(distance_hav)) %>%
  mutate(z_dist = (distance_hav - mean_dist) / sd_dist)

set.seed(20)

fviz_nbclust(standardized_euro[,8:11], kmeans, method = "wss") + geom_vline(xintercept = 3, linetype = 2)

```

Because this the "elbow method" of deriving the optimal number of clusters, we are looking for the value in the bend of the graph, here that is 3.

Now that we know the optimal number of clusters, we can perform a cluster analysis on our data with 3 clusters.

```{r ML1, message=FALSE}

clusters <- kmeans(standardized_euro[,8:11], 3)

standardized_euro$Cluster_num <- as.character(clusters$cluster)

str(clusters)

```

An interesting value to note here is the sizes, cluster 3 is much bigger than 1 and 2.

Now we can create visual output to see if our hypothesis is correct or not.


```{r ML2, message=FALSE}
network_euro <- standardized_euro %>% 
  group_by(To_country) %>% 
  summarize(max_point <- max(total_point)) 

standardized_euro <- merge(x=standardized_euro, y=network_euro, by=c("To_country"))

network_euro <- standardized_euro %>% filter(total_point == `max_point <- max(total_point)`)

eurovision_temp1 <- standardized_euro %>% filter(edge_weight >= 0.3)



my_net <- network(network_euro %>% select(From_country, To_country), directed = TRUE, matrix.type="edgelist")
my_net %v% "color" = ifelse(network_euro$Cluster_num %in% c("1"), "1", (ifelse(network_euro$Cluster_num %in% c("2"), "2", "3")))

ggnet2(my_net, label = TRUE, arrow.size = 6, arrow.gap = 0.025, edge.size = as.vector(network_euro$edge_weight), color = "color", palette = "Set2")


network_euro %>%
ggplot(aes(x=z_dist, y = z_point, color = Cluster_num, label = To_country)) +
  geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Clusters in relation to standardized and centered distance and point value", x = "Distance", y = "Point values") +
  geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE)

```
